Challenge 6.1 (Simple)
Select an existing shortlist (from an academic, institutional, or otherwise authoritative source—give full reference) of factors or “pillars” that democracy can be said to consist of. Motivate why this list best captures the aspects of democracy that you consider essential, referring to at least one scholarly or institutional justification.
Based on your shortlist, identify which democratic factors face the greatest danger from current and foreseeable developments (technological, political, economic, or social).
For each factor you select, briefly explain the specific mechanism by which the development threatens it, giving references.
Max 250 words, not including references (fewer words may be regarded as a strength).
