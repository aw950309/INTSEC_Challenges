(Simple):
Go read the sources of Samy and/or the explanations of its author to answer the following questions:
Myspace prevented users to add most html tags such as <script>, where did Samy put his code?
Myspace prevented user to use essential keywords of javascript such as innerHTML, how did Samy bypassed this limitation?
Write a one-sentence explanation for each of these questions.

Samy Kamkar found a way to bypass these filters and inject JavaScript into his profile on MySpace. The injected code was designed to add Samy as a friend to anyone who viewed his profile and then replicate the same code onto their profile pages.

This created a self-propagating worm that spread rapidly across the MySpace network.

When a user viewed that profile page [of the infected user], the payload would then be replicated and planted on their own profile page continuing the distribution of the worm. MySpace has since secured its site against the vulnerability.[1]
